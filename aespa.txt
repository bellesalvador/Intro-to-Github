It contains a short description of “aespa”, one of my favorite K-pop groups.

“aespa” is a four-member girl group under SM Entertainment.

They debuted on November 17, 2020, with the song “Black Mamba.”

Members:

- Karina

- Giselle

- Winter

- NingNing

Their concept combines real members with virtual avatars (æ), which makes their theme unique compared to other groups.
